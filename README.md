ABOUT PROJECT
This project demonstrates a complete data preprocessing workflow commonly used in machine learning and data analysis. The steps include handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and outlier treatment.

üîç Key Insights Gained from Task-1:
Comprehensive Data Preprocessing
Developed the ability to systematically clean, format, and structure raw datasets to make them suitable for machine learning models.

Categorical Data Encoding
Explored various encoding strategies such as:

Label Encoding for ordinal data,

One-Hot Encoding for nominal categories,

And understood why transforming categories into numerical form is essential for most machine learning algorithms.

Feature Scaling Techniques
Gained hands-on experience with:

Min-Max Normalization,

Z-score Standardization,

Robust Scaling to handle outliers.
Understood their importance in ensuring that features contribute equally to distance-based and gradient-based models.

Outlier Detection and Handling
Learned how to:

Identify outliers using statistical methods like the Interquartile Range (IQR) and Z-scores,

Visualize them with boxplots,

Apply corrective measures such as removal, transformation, or capping to maintain data quality.

Designing a Reusable Preprocessing Pipeline
Built a structured, consistent, and modular workflow that can be easily adapted to different datasets, promoting reproducibility and efficiency in data science projects.
